# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (previously Volar) and disable Vetur

- Use [vue-tsc](https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools/tree/master/packages/tsc) for performing the same type checking from the command line, or for generating d.ts files for SFCs.

### Comments on Implementation

- These comments below aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the decisions made in the implementation and suggest potential areas for further enhancement or alternative approaches.

#### Assumptions Made

1. **Use of Vuetify**: It is assumed that the Vuetify UI library is preferred for its pre-built components and responsiveness.
2. **Vuex for State Management**: Assumed Vuex is the state management tool of choice due to its central store and ability to handle complex state logic.
3. **FilePond for File Uploads**: Assumed FilePond is used for its rich features like file validation, image previews, and transformations.
4. **Modular Component Design**: Assumed that the application should be modular, with reusable components like Header, Footer, and various pages.
5. **API-Based and Session-Based Data Storage**: Assumed there might be scenarios where both API-based and session storage for user profiles are needed.

#### Techniques Used and Reasons

1. **Vue.js and TypeScript**: Combined for better type safety and improved development experience.
2. **Vuetify**: Used for consistent design and ease of implementation of Material Design components.
3. **Vue Router**: Implemented for SPA navigation, enhancing user experience with client-side routing.
4. **Vuex**: Centralized state management to manage form data and user profile information effectively.
5. **FilePond**: Selected for handling file uploads due to its robust feature set for managing file input.
6. **Moment.js**: Used for date handling and formatting to ensure consistency and ease of manipulation of date values.
7. **Scoped Styles**: Ensured styles do not leak outside component scope, preserving modularity and maintainability.
8. **Responsive Design**: Applied media queries and responsive components to ensure usability across various devices.

#### Alternative Solutions

1. **UI Libraries**: Instead of Vuetify, other UI libraries like Element Plus or Bootstrap Vue could be used.
2. **State Management**: Pinia could be an alternative to Vuex, offering a lighter and more modern approach.
3. **Date Handling**: Day.js or native JavaScript Date objects could be alternatives to Moment.js for date manipulation.
4. **File Uploads**: Alternatives to FilePond include Dropzone.js or directly using HTML5 file input and handling file logic manually.
5. **Styling**: Instead of scoped styles, CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components could be considered for more dynamic styling.

#### Additional Comments

1. **Form Validation**: Custom rules are implemented for form validation; using a library like Vuelidate or Yup could provide more advanced validation features.
2. **Error Handling**: More robust error handling should be added, especially for API calls, to provide better user feedback.
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure all components adhere to accessibility standards, especially for form inputs and navigation elements.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading of routes and components could be implemented to improve initial load times.
5. **Testing**: Unit tests for components and integration tests for the Vuex store and router should be added to ensure robustness and prevent regressions.
